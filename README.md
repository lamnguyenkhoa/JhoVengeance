## Basics of the game

Jho's vengeance is centred around Jho, our dino protagonist, living in the cyberpunk-esque future in Japan-Gea, on his quest for vengeance against those who killed his father.
He must battle his way through enemies to continue on his quest to kill Lord Long-Neck, who lives in the cyber-facility near Jho's peaceful village.

Combat is simple - left click to attack, right click to parry attacks, 'e' to pick up objects, 'f' to fire projectiles, 'q' to switch oh-hand weapons
and space to dash in the direction of the mouse. To access the inventory UI, press 'tab'. Hover over images in the inventory to see a tooltip.

There is a tutorial level that explains this system firsthand.

### Instruction

If using the source project, start the game at `StartMenu` scene, which can be located in `Assets\Scenes`.
